# Web API with simpleChain blockchain  

This program creates 4 custom API endpoints for the simpleChain blockchain.<br>

The simpleChain blockchain creates a private blockchain that includes SHA256 to hash each block and level to create a
persistent database.<br>

The class Blockchain constructor creates the genesis block. The addBlock function will get the current chain height and then add a new block to the chain and console log messages will print to screen the hash information. Validation functions include validateBlock and validateChain - console log messages will print to screen showing block hash and previous hash information. By default, when the program runs, 10 blocks are automatically created.<br>

The Web API calls include:<br>
1. Call to Root to display Welcome Message - use "localhost:8000/"<br>
1. Call to GET all blocks - use "localhost:8000/blocks"<br>
1. Call to GET a specific block - use "localhost:8000/block/:id", where id is the number of the block to GET<br>
1. Call to POST a new block - use "localhost:8000/block" and the POST details include:<br>
  1. Use application/json as the format type and enter the block in json format <br>
      {
        "block": "the body contents of whatever you want"
      }


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Installing Node and NPM is pretty straightforward using the installer package available from the (Node.jsÂ® web site)[https://nodejs.org/en/].

### Configuring your project

- Use NPM to initialize your project and create package.json to store project dependencies.
```
npm init
```
- Install crypto-js with --save flag to save dependency to our package.json file
```
npm install crypto-js --save
```
- Install level with --save flag
```
npm install level --save
```

## Testing

### Test by running program
1: Move to directory with simpleChain.js  
2: Run simpleChain.js by entering> "node simpleChain.js"<br>

### Test using REPL
To test code using Node REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop)  
1: Open a command prompt or shell terminal after install node.js.  
2: Enter a node session, also known as REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop).  
```
node
```
3: Copy and paste your code into your node session  
4: Instantiate blockchain with blockchain variable
```
let blockchain = new Blockchain();
```
5: Generate 10 blocks using a for loop
```
for (var i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
  blockchain.addBlock(new Block("test data "+i));
}
```
6: Validate blockchain
```
blockchain.validateChain();
```
7: Induce errors by changing block data
```
let inducedErrorBlocks = [2,4,7];
for (var i = 0; i < inducedErrorBlocks.length; i++) {
  blockchain.chain[inducedErrorBlocks[i]].data='induced chain error';
}
```
8: Validate blockchain. The chain should now fail with blocks 2,4, and 7.
```
blockchain.validateChain();
```
